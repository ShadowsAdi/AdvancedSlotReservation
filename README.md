# AdvancedSlotReservation
Advanced Version for slot reservation. 

This script can detect if the player's Name / Password / IP Address is reserved ( working with users.ini, AmxBans, anything using dynamic admins storage ) and it automatically kicks a player from server based on a certain criteria ( spectator, bot, admin / non-admin, played time ), only if the server is full.
